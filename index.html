             Hi, I am Gauresh. Born in Mumbai, I was raised by the 90s which meant no computer until 10th grade. Data, let alone Analytics seemed terribly fatuous back then and, I was only honestly interested in Pacman & Pinball. But, technology always kept me fascinating of a world from Back to the Future. Growing up I pursued Computer Sciences as a learning track and completed my Bachelors in Information Technology from Mumbai University. I moved to the United States in 2017 to pursue a graduate degree in Information Systems and based out of Boston, Massachusetts ever since.

            <p>
              Explore liquor sales dataset for the state of Iowa and utilize Hadoop ecosystem components to derive actionable insights helpful for any liquor store owner/retailer to make a well-informed decision
              <br><br>
              The dataset contains the spirits purchase information of Iowa Class 'E' liquor licenses by product and date of purchase from January 2012 - November 2019. It has close to 17 Million rows across 17 columns where each row represents a transaction.
              <br><br>
              While there were numerous questions that could be answered using this dataset, I chose to take 5 use cases that summarized sales information, top liquor labels and their performance over the years and expansion opportunities using Zip code analysis.

              <div class="subheading"><h6>LEARNINGS:</h6></div>

                <ul>
                  <li> Writing MapReduce code in Java. Unlike most analytical tools where computing takes place in the background and in most cases, is invisible to the user, I had an opportunity to write mapper & reducer code from scratch. I took advantage of Writable() & WritableComparable() interfaces from Hadoop which reduces the data size enormously by serializing it. It helps in easy exchange of data between networks.
                  </li>
                  <li>Using Pig scripts to decrease processing time. Theoretically and practically Pig is supposed to be faster than MapReduce and twice of simple. Additionally, Pig being a scripting language, can help in data cleaning as well. I performed filtering while working with zipcode analysis where I encountered a couple of anomalies.
                  </li>
                  <li>Querying on Hive. Hive enables you to write a SQL query which gets converted to a mapreduce job. So, if you have a SQL query that suits your analysis, you can implement in Hadoop using Hive instead of writing a long MapReduce job for the same. Also, Hive is pretty fast, it took about 12 minutes to crunch 17 Million records.
                  </li>

        <div class="subheading"><h6>GOAL:</h6></div>
        <p>Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. So what exactly drives this demand? One might say the time of the day; times between 9am-5pm could see the highest surges as people are commuting to & from from work/home. Another guess could be the weather; rain/snow/heat/humidity can cause people to take more rides.
          <br><br>
          My aim was to try & analyze the prices of these apps to highlight factors driving the demand.

          <div class="subheading"><h6>LEARNINGS:</h6></div>

            <ul>
              <li> We are often told to not judge a book by its cover. This applies to data as well & in fact forms a fundamental principle to begin with. Sometimes even the things we see with our naked eyes is not the 'naked' truth. While looking at the characteristics of data, I found roughly 7% of 'Prices' were nulls and unfavorable as it was my target variable. I used Scikit-Learn's Imputer() to replace nulls by mean value of the column. Further, I worked in Seaborn library in plotting graphs that showed investigative insights into the cab data and I've got to admit that it was the most fun thing to do.
              </li>
              <li> I was working with over 50 variables in my data and there was no way to gauge how each variable contributes to the target. Moreover, building a model off of these many variables could potentially diminish its performance. This is where feature engineering comes in, as it boils down to problem representation. If your data has great features that represent the problem well, chances are your model will give better results as it has learned the pattern well.
              </li>
              <li>Model Hyperparameters are crucial as they control the overall behaviour of a machine learning model. The ultimate goal is to find an optimal combination of hyperparameters that minimizes a predefined loss function to give better results. Failure to do so would give sub-optimal results as the model didn’t converge and minimize the loss function effectively.
              </li>
              <li>Always remember, data will talk to you only if you're willing to listen.
              </li>

          I did this project for my Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence class in Spring 2018. The aim of this project was to design a snow-flake Data Warehouse and have it populated with data through integrations jobs.
          <br><br>
          The source of the data used was Microsoft's Contoso Retail data which comprised of product and customer information. To replicate a real world scenario, some of the data was divided into 4 separate databases and the rest in form of flat files. At the very end, a dashboard had to be prepared to summarize information stored in facts.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Designing ETL jobs: I used Talend Data Integration & SQL Server Intergration Services (SSIS)
        to build data migration jobs. With the help of documentation and helpful videos, I was able to grasp the best practices while building jobs i.e. color coding, naming data sources, job layout etc. Additionally, in a real world scenario, no one really wants to sit and execute every job in order. To automate, I built a master job by linking individual jobs synchronously & in parallel just so everything can be executed in one go.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dealing with historic data: The whole purpose of a data warehouse is to be able to store/archive data for future use. I used slowly changing dimensions (SCD) to keep track and record changes if any.
              </li>
              <li>Data Quality testing: It is necessary to keep track of the data going from one system to other, assess efficiency and speed of the processes to achieve fast and best results. Throughout different stages of the project, as and when necessary, I performed several tests which included checking column names, data types & length, column indexes, incompleteness of data, correct data format, accurate row counts, transformed data, correct order of ETL jobs and its runtime.
              </li>

          To evaluate user needs and specify functional requirements for a new web or smartphone application.
          <br><br>
          The product, EasyLive is a (make-believe) web application that serves as a portal for prospective tenants to rent apartments and for landlords/leasing managements to efficiently manage requests coming their way.

            <ul>
              <li>
                 First step to designing a product is to understand and realize the problem it is going to solve, people it is going to affect and why is it necessary for the product to be out there in the market.
              </li>
              <li>
                 Research and learn from the experiences of others - this can help you find out about the existing solutions to similar problems and avoid mistakes that were made in the past.
              </li>
              <li>
                 Identify risks and dependencies for all parties involved. I prepared a Market Requirement Document summarizing information on these areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                 Its important to visualize the product before you start working on it. I wrote a verbal walkthrough of use cases that included possible use cases my application could serve considering the customer segment I was targeting. This included a step by step description of what a user would do on my product. It was followed by wireframing - creating mockups to give a sense of what the product should look like.
              </li>
              <li>
                I included a roadmap of stages my product will be going through as it moves forward. Eachstage corresponds to a quarter of a year and comprises of Goals, Features & KPIs for thatstage.
              </li>
              <li>
                Further, I delved into writing some metrics that can be a reflection of my product's performance i.e. website visits, new account registrations, bounce rate, average time spent on website etc. Lastly, I presented a breakdown of fundamental costs and a mitigation strategy for the risks posed in Market Requirement Documentation.
